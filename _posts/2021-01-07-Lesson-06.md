### What there is more?

Oh yeah! There is way more about CSS! Until now we just got an impression what CSS is like and what to do with it. 

Unfortunately we will not learn everything about it. But with this basic knowledge you are prepared for most websites and are capable of learn the rest by yourself!

### Positions

One important thing about every box in CSS is that they have a position property. What does that mean? It is not about their distance from the borders. Therefore you can use the margin command. No the position command is more essential. There are four different states a box can be described. 
 
The default setting of every element has the `position: static;`. This is how you will see it in the browser. It gets affected by the surrounded elements and can be "pushed" around, it simply flows into your code.  

The `position: relative;` only has some minor differences of how it responses to some CSS values like `top`. You probably will not need this one except in very special occasions which you would have to google anyway I suppose.

More exciting are the positions **absolute** and **fixed**. Using `position: absolute;` the position of the element is (oh wonder) absolute. This means it will not be affected as much by the other elements. If you need one element at a specific position, no matter what, you can use the `position: absolute;`, e.g. you need the logo of a company in the very top left corner of the page.  

The `position: fixed;` is even more special. With this command the element stays on the position you give it, but regarding your window not your webpage! What does this mean? If you scroll down the box will stay on this specific position, not regarding your other content. This makes sense for example if you have some kind of navigation that you want to be always on the left side so the user has always the ability to click on it.

### The display property

As the _position_ property the _display_ property is already given to each element by default, but every HTML tag has a different value. E.g. an element like `<i></i>` for cursive texts has a `display: inline;`.  

What does that mean? There are many different ways to display elements, the four most important are `inline, inline-block, block` and `none`.  

Each of them handles your code differently. `display: inline;` for example takes your code and puts it into your layout like text. Therefore breaks apply to them as well as `text-align` or similar. `inline-block` does basically the same, but puts in addition a box around it. You know one element very well that (for whatever reason) uses this as default, the `<img />` tag. Also the properties for text elements apply as well as you can put things around usually only boxes can do.  

Coming to these. The `display: block;` describes a box. That means it will be taken as a whole element where nothing can be wrapped around even if it would be smaller. All div-layers are block-elements, but e.g. your headlines are some too!  
The most obvious display command is probably the `display: none;`, it simply does not show the element. Sometimes this comes in very handy, but you will figure out reasons for this by time.

### Why do I hear all that?

First of all it is of course important to know some background to know how to code things. On the other hand it is sometimes very helpful to change usually given properties. E.g. I often change the display status of images to `block` so it does not mess up my texts. Maybe you should try it out to see the full potential of changing the values.

### Pseudo classes

You know classes now very well and got familiar using them. But what you probably did not know that strange things as _pseudo classes_ exist. Why this strange name? _Pseudo_?  
Pseudo classes are classes that you do not really give an element, the element somehow can have the class added by the browser. E.g. if you go with your mouse over a specific element it will get a **hover** class.

Just as every other class you can describe properties for those pseudo classes. Ever wondered how links change their colour while you are pointing them? That is the magical trick behind it!

```css
a {
	color: #1ABC9C;
}
a:hover {
	color: #bdc3c7;
}
```

Like classes you write them directly into your CSS code, but this time we use colons (`:`) instead of a simple dot. We put this pseudo class directly after the tag that we want to change. If we do not do this all elements will get affected and that would confuse every user.

There are a couple of pseudo classes, some more useful, some not. Here is a list of these, but I think you need to try them out yourself:

|`:hover`|directly pointing at it with the cursor|
|`:active`|directly in the moment it is clicked at|
|`:visited`|visited link|
|`:first-child`|first element of a series (e.g. lists)|
|`:last-child`|last  element of a series|
|`:nth-child(2n)`|nth element of a list|
|`:before`|before the element|
|`:after`|after  the element|

### Nice things for boxes

Since a couple of years we are glad to have CSS3\. Since this huge development it is possible to add small things as shadows or rounded corners. It might sound stupid to you, but when I started coding I had to build at least three div-layers with different backgrounds to get a nice box with rounded corners! 
 
This means we can simply add this command to our element and it gets the new design. Big additional benefits of this are that you save a lot of space and it works on every browser. If an older browser does not support the shadow command for example, it simply does not show it instead of messing up all your code.

```css
.superBox {
	background: #1ABC9C;
	border-radius: 3px;
	/* The values: distance-left distance-top blur color */
	box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px #bdc3c7;
}
```

Here is an example how such a box could look like:

### Background

One of the most important things when it actually comes to styling websites is the thing with the background of boxes. As you know there is the possibility of adding a specific background color to your elements, but aren't there more possibilities? Yes there are! Of course you could implement an image instead.

```css
#wrapper {
	background: url("images/background.jpg") top left;
}
```

The background can easily implemented using the `url("")` snippet. In the quotation marks you simply refer to the image you want to use by linking to it. if the image is smaller than the box it automatically gets endlessly repeated. Of course you can prohibit that by writing afterwards `no-repeat`.
  
The not mandatory values `top left` tell the browser where it should start using the background referring to the box that has this property. `right` and `bottom` are an option as well, but more interesting is the value `center` which puts the image in the middle of the box. Be aware that values that would colidate with each other are not possible and always the last one would be taken (like `top` and `bottom`).

Since the development of CSS3 we have even more commands to give that often come in handy. Concerning the background the most important is the `background-size` command. Here we can define values like we do with `width` and `height` so going for pixels, but more interesting are the values `contain` and `cover`.  

While **contain** automatically scales the image into a size that it fits into the box, so you can see all of it, **cover** is the brother that scales the image automatically into a size, so the whole box is covered with the image.  
This gets very important when you, e.g., want to build a website that has a header in which you want to have an image that fills up the whole box:

```css
#header {
	background: url("images/clouds.jpg") center;
	background-size: cover;
}
```

### Transitions (and transform)

Again since this development it is also possible to do small animations without using additional code like javascript. Therefore we simply need to write down `transition` and then the property we want to have a transition with and the duration.  

E.g. you want links to change their color smoothly:

```css
a {
	color: #1ABC9C;
	transition: color 0.5s;
}
a:hover {
	color: #bdc3c7;
}
```

### Old browsers

Using the new commands is always a bit tricky when it comes to old browsers. Some of them, maybe only one year old, just can not understand this code unless you add a small prefix to those commands. Very old browsers will never get these commands, no matter how hard you try adding it up using CSS.  
Those prefixes differ from browser-type to browser-type. To be sure it works in every browser you should add all of them, it could look like this:

```css
a {
	color: #1ABC9C;
	/* Overall / new browsers */
	transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Mozilla Firefox */
	-moz-transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Opera */
	-o-transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Apple Safari / Google Chrome */
	-webkit-transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Microsoft Internet Explorer */
	-ms-transition: color 0.5s;
}
```
