### What there is more?

Oh yeah! There is way more about CSS! Until now, we just got an impression of what CSS is like and what to do with it. 

Unfortunately, we will not learn everything about it—as if one would ever know everything about CSS. But with this basic knowledge, you are prepared for most websites!

### Positions

One important thing about every box in CSS is that they have a `position` property. What does that mean? It is not about their distance from the edges. For that, you can use the `margin` property. No, the `position` property is more foundational. There are five different position states a box can be described with. 
 
The default setting of every element is `position: static;`. This is how you will see it in the browser. It gets affected by the surrounding elements and can be "pushed" around. It merely flows in your code.  

The `relative` only has some minor differences to `static`. However, it can be useful for parent elements of `absolute` or `sticky` elements. I tend to give all my elements the `position: relative;` property by default to not get issues with `absolute` or `sticky`. This would look like this:

```css
/* The * selector selects every element. */
* {
	position: relative;
}
```

More exciting are the positions `absolute`, `fixed`, and `sticky`. Using `position: absolute;`, the element’s position is—oh wonder—absolute. It will not be affected by other elements. If you need an element at a specific place, no matter what, you can use the `absolute`, e.g., you need the logo of a company in the very top left corner of the page. Period. It will refer to the parent component if it is set to `relative`, otherwise to the webpage itself.

The `position: fixed;` is even more special. With this property, the element stays in the position you give it, like with `absolute`, but regarding your window, not the overall webpage or parent container! What does this mean? If you scroll down, the box will stay on this specific position, not regarding your other content. For example, this makes sense if you have some kind of navigation that you want to be always on the top so the user can click on it all the time.

`position: sticky;` is also quite exciting. It allows a box to follow the user’s scrolling behavior, but only until the parent container’s end is reached. Keep in mind that at least one directional property has to be set for this to work, e.g., `top: 20px;`.



### The display property

Like the `position` property, the `display` property is already given to each element by default, but every HTML tag has a different value. E.g. an element like `<i></i>` for cursive texts has a `display: inline;`.  

What does that mean? There are many different ways to display elements. The four most important are `inline`, `inline-block`, `block`, and `none`.  

Each of them handles your code differently. `display: inline;` for example, takes your code and puts it into your layout like text. Therefore breaks apply to it as well as `text-align` or similar. `inline-block` does basically the same but puts, in addition, a box around it. You know one element very well that—for whatever reason—uses this as default, the `<img />` tag. Also, the properties for text elements apply, and you can add properties that usually only apply for boxes like a `border-radius`.  

Now to them. The `display: block;` describes a box. That means it will be taken as a whole element where nothing can be wrapped around, even if it would be smaller. All div-layers are block elements, but, e.g., headlines or paragraphs are some too!  

The most obvious display property is probably the `none`. It simply does not show the element. Sometimes this comes in very handy, but you will figure out reasons for this over time.

### Pseudo classes

You know classes now very well and got familiar with using them. But what you probably did not realize that strange things as “pseudo-classes” exist. Why this strange name? “Pseudo”?  
Pseudo-classes are classes that you do not actually give an element. The element somehow can have the class added by the browser. E.g., if you go with your mouse over a specific element, it will get a `:hover` pseudo-class.

Just as every other class, you can describe properties for those pseudo-classes. Have you ever wondered how links change their color while you are pointing them? That is the magic trick behind it!

```css
a {
	color: #1ABC9C;
}
a:hover {
	color: #bdc3c7;
}
```

Like regular classes, you write them directly into your CSS code, but this time we use colons `:` instead of a simple dot. We put this pseudo-class directly after the tag that we want to change. If we do not do this, all elements will get affected, which would confuse our user.

There are a couple of pseudo-classes, some more useful, some not. Here is a list of these, but I think you need to try them out yourself:

|`:hover`|directly pointing at it with the cursor|
|`:active`|directly at the moment it is clicked|
|`:visited`|visited link|
|`:first-child`|the first element of a series (e.g., lists)|
|`:last-child`|the last element of a series|
|`:nth-child(2n)`|the nth element of a list|
|`:before`|before the element|
|`:after`|after the element|

### Nice things for boxes

For a couple of years, we are glad to have CSS3. Since this huge development, it is possible to add small things, such as shadows or rounded corners. It might sound stupid to you, but when I started coding, I had to build at least three div-layers with different backgrounds to get a nice box with rounded corners! 
 
Now we can simply add this command to our element, and it gets the new design. Significant additional benefits of this are that you save a lot of data storage, it works on every browser, and if not, it is down-gradable. If an older browser does not support the shadow command, for example, it simply does not show it instead of messing up all your code.

```css
.superBox {
	background: #1ABC9C;
	border-radius: 3px;
	/* The values: distance-left distance-top blur spread color */
	box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px 0px #bdc3c7;
}
```

Here is an example how such a box could look like:

<div class="demoBlockMargin" style="background: #1ABC9C; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 6px 6px 0px 0px #bdc3c7;"></div>

### Background

One of the most important things when it comes to styling websites is the background of boxes. As you know, there is the possibility of adding a specific background color to your elements, but aren't there more possibilities? Yes, there are! Of course, you could use an image instead.

```css
#wrapper {
	background: url("images/background.jpg") top left;
}
```

The background can easily be implemented using the `url("")` snippet. You simply refer to the image you want to use in the quotation marks by linking to it. If the image is smaller than the box, it automatically gets endlessly repeated or tiled. Of course, you can prohibit that by writing afterward `no-repeat` or add the property `background-repeat: none;`.
  
The optional values `top left` tell the browser where it should start using the background referring to the box that has this property. `right` and `bottom` are an option as well, but more interesting is the value `center` which puts the image in the middle of the box. Be aware that values that would collide with each other are not possible, and always the last one would be taken (like `top` and `bottom`).

Since the development of CSS3, we have even more properties to give that often come in handy. Concerning the background, the most important is—in my opinion—the `background-size` property. Here we can define values as we do with `width` and `height`, so going for pixels, but more interesting are the values `contain` and `cover`.  

While `contain` automatically scales the image into a size that it fits into the box so that you can see all of it, `cover` is the sibling that scales the image automatically into a size, so the image is covering the whole box. This gets very important when you, e.g., want to build a website that has a header in which you want to have an image that fills up the whole box:

```css
#header {
	background: url("images/clouds.jpg") center center;
	background-size: cover;
}
```

### `transition`, `animation`, and `transform`

Since this development, it is also possible to do small animations without using additional code like javascript. Therefore we simply need to write down `transition` and then the property we want to transition with and the duration. You could think of it as two keyframes set in _AfterEffects_ and the time between the keyframes. By default, the transitions are set to `ease`. E.g. you want links to change their color smoothly:

```css
a {
	color: #1ABC9C;
	transition: color 0.5s;
}
a:hover {
	color: #bdc3c7;
}
```

If you want to do repeating animations, which should happen automatically, not on interaction, you can use the `animation` property. Here you need to define the animation separately, but it’s the same principle of keyframes. It could look like this:[^1]

```css
.mpBox {
	height: 20px;
	background: #1ABC9C;
	/* the name of the animation, the duration, the timing, the number of repeats, the direction */
	animation: barSizeChange 15s ease infinite alternate-reverse;    
}

@keyframes barSizeChange {
	0% {
		width: 10px;
	}
	100%  {
		width: 100px;
	}
}
```


Also, it got relatively easy to transform elements, meaning to rotate or skew them. Simply use the `transform` property.[^2]

```css
.myImage {
	transform: rotate(35deg);
}
```


### Old browsers

Using the new commands is always a bit tricky when it comes to old browsers. Some of them, maybe only one year old, just can not understand this code unless you add a small prefix to those commands. Very old browsers will never get these commands, no matter how hard you try adding it up using CSS.  

Those prefixes differ from browser-type to browser-type. To be sure it works in every browser you should add all of them, it could look like this:

```css
a {
	color: #1ABC9C;
	/* Overall / new browsers */
	transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Mozilla Firefox */
	-moz-transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Opera */
	-o-transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Apple Safari / Google Chrome */
	-webkit-transition: color 0.5s;
	/* Microsoft Internet Explorer */
	-ms-transition: color 0.5s;
}
```


### And more, and more, and more…

CSS is constantly developing. I often stumble upon new properties or values like the value `currentColor`, enabling the current text color for other properties like `border-color`. Also, CSS supports now [filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter), which might be interesting. 

There are simply too many exciting things happening, so keep your eyes open! I recommend following [Josh W. Comeau](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) on Twitter. He often posts interesting new tiny snippets.
