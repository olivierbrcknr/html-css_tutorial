### Talking about time

When it comes to actually build websites of course a lot of data, e.g. images, are needed. Everyone who did some layouts already knows how much storage these take on your hard-drive. But when it comes to websites this problem gets even worse.  
Everyone of you has already been on a website that took longer than a couple of seconds to load and then probably thought: "naahhh, then I won't have a look on this one". You might say a couple of seconds is not that much, but try it out, it will seem like an eternity to you!  

But why are taking some websites so much longer? You know the answer of course. Too much data! Like transferring files onto an USB stick it takes some time until everything is read. The same principle we have for websites with the only difference that everything is read a lot slower. You realized this probably when downloading ... stuff.  

Certainly the speed of the provider, your internet connection and many other factors have something to say here as well, but in the end we want to make a website appealing for everyone, so we try to make it as small as possible.

### What is about the right size?

Depending on the website that could differ. For a mobile site it usually should be way smaller than for a desktop site. And the connections get faster and faster with time, that means the acceptable size of websites increases continuously. 
 
But talking about sizes we do not talk about gigabytes, we do not even talk about a high number of megabytes. An average website should have not more than **2 MB** these days, and even that is a high value! (Just to get an impression, _this_ website has less than 100 KB.)

### That is impossible!

Actually it is not! As you might know there are a lot of websites around the internet and all of them keep their size very low. You might wonder how they get websites smaller than even one of those images you wanted to implement into your layout.  

Therefore some tools are existing to shrink down the size of your images. _Adobe Photoshop_ for example has this function _save for web_. With this feature you can save images in the exact size, quality and format you need, so it gets shrank down to lowest size possible.

Here is an example what difference this could make:


<div class="multiImages">
{% include lazyload.html image_src="rotterdam.jpg" image_alt="Rotterdam" subtitle="An image in its original size. 3,5 MB" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="rotterdam_web.jpg" image_alt="Rotterdam Web" subtitle="The same image shrank down to a width of 600px and saved for web. 0,13 MB" %}
</div>

If you download both images you will realize that the one on the right is way smaller in pixel and data size, but different as in print, the visitor will not see the difference unless he downloads the image or would you have seen the difference in those pictures above? In most cases that is a case we do not need or want the user to download the image, so why adding it in this big size?

Sometimes it is necessary to add big pictures or a lot of them. For those reasons it is good to implement javascript as [lazyload](http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/lazyload). With such scripts the images will get loaded right in the moment they are needed and not in advance. Therefore the first load will get a lot smaller. You can try out if you will get it to work.

### The different formats

Using the function _save for web_ in Photoshop you get the option between `.jpg`, `.png` and `.gif.` I assume you have heard of all of these formats. But do you know which to use when? Are there differences and if so which?  

First of all, look at what you want to achieve with your image. Does it need a transparent background? Should it move? Is it good how it is? Depending on what you need you should use a specific format. There are a couple of these. Here I listed up when to use which one:

In most case you should use the **.jpg** format. It is the overall standard for all pictures. If you save it as a .jpg you will not have transparency nor movement, but a really small size and still a good quality. You can even shrink down the quality to 80% without loosing too much from the image, what saves you again around half of the image data size.

If you need transparent parts, e.g. a cut out object in front of your colorful background, you need to use the **.png** format. This allows you to have an additional _alpha_ value for each pixel. Does not change much for your workflow but it adds up a couple of kilobytes.

The latest use of the internet showed us a lot of those moving memes and with it the war about the pronunciation of the **.gif**. But for designing it is just important to know that this format allows you to have a small sequence of images. Important is to know, that of course each frame gives the final "image" a lot of extra data! Therefore the .gif format is the biggest in size, they often get even multiple megabytes by only using three images. I just would propose to use as few gifs as possible.

### One more

Especially in times of _responsive web design_ images which are endlessly scalable are more and more important. You are familiar with such files: These vector files we work with all the time in _Adobe Illustrator_ for example.  
You can save files in different formats out of such programs, e.g. .ai, .dxf or .pdf, but there is one format that you probably read a lot but never cared this much about: **.svg**. This format can also be read by browsers. It has multiple benefits: It is super small in storage and it has no scale limit! But you can only use it, like all the shapes in Illustrator, with overall fill colors and not images.

### How should I name my files?

By doing the last exercises you probably got an impression of how annoying it is to write the <u>exact</u> name of a file so it can be read. To not get even more problems it is very important to name your documents and images the right way. 
 
Especially in languages like german or Swedish there are some of these special letters like _ü, ö or å_. Computers really do not like those. That means you must avoid them. But what is even more annoying, computers do not like _spaces_ as well! Your operating system has a well thought through code to avoid this problem, but unfortunately the web and browsers have not. Therefore you should replace all your spacings with _underscores_ or _minus_ symbols.  

Another part is, that some languages of your code look at the different writing with capitals and other languages do not. Therefore I would propose to avoid using _capitals_ as well.  
Also try to avoid _dots_. Nowadays it should not be a problem anymore, but I always try to stay save and do not use them in names in case some old browsers might have some troubles. But now that should finally be it!  
Here is an example of how an image should be named: `rotterdam_groen_08-29-2015.jpg`.

### How to locate them?

Now that it comes that you want to write websites from scratch it probably gets important to know how to locate files only using text, the **URL**.

Every time you wanted to link to a specific file you usually wrote down the name of the file, because it was in the same folder or you just copied a link out of your browser, looking like this: `<a href="http://google.com"> Link</a>`.

If it comes that you want to keep your files in a better structure using folders you only need to add the name of your folder to this link. Let's say you have your .html file in some directory and in the same folder as your .html file you have the folder _"images"_ in which you have that amazing picture of your cat: _"mr_snuggles.jpg"_. Now you write into your code of your _img_ tag the folder as well, looking like this: `<img src="images/mr_snuggles.jpg" />`.  

If you have something in a folder further above the one you are actual in with your file referring to, you simply add two dots, e.g. `<a href="../home.html">Home</a>`. 
 
That is the way you navigate to files! Always keep in mind in which file you are in right now and how often you need to step one folder back or which folder further in. That can be as complex as you want: `<a href="../../works/year_one/portfolio.html">That is my portfolio</a>`.

Referring to some website you add the `http://`. This snippet tells your browser to look into the world wide web and then the next directory. Without these letters your browser will think the file you are linking to is on the same directory as your own website.  

By just using the slash symbol (`/`) in an URL, your browser will start at the very first folder of your server. If you try this on a local file somewhere onto you desktop it might confuse you, but this link would go to your hard drive of your computer and you would have to navigate to your desktop like shown before.
  
Therefore I would propose to use always relative paths (referring to the file you are in and then dots or folders). Only use the absolute when it is impossible to use relative paths.

### More than Comic Sans

Now that we talked about images and naming stuff you probably want to know how to add other fonts than just those few save web fonts as Verdana or Times New Roman. As I wrote in the paragraph above, computers, and especially browsers, are very dumb and stubborn. Each browser has its own format and therefore you need to provide the fontface in every format to your website. Afterwards you need to tell your .css file which files belongs to font.

In CSS3 there is a new function for implementing fonts, called `@font-face`. So how does it work? Here is an example:

```css
@font-face {
	/* Here the name is defined we later use in our CSS. */
	font-family: "Source Code Pro";
	/* Then we add the files needed actually containing the font. */
	src: url("fonts/SourceCodePro.eot");
	src: url("fonts/SourceCodePro.eot?#iefix") format('embedded-opentype'),
	     url("fonts/SourceCodePro.woff") format("woff"),
	     url("fonts/SourceCodePro.ttf") format("truetype"),
	     url("fonts/SourceCodePro.svg") format("svg");
	/* Here we tell the browser what weight and style the font is. */
	font-weight: normal;
	font-style: normal;
}
```

Because exporting the font in all these different formats and implementing it for every font style is very annoying, cool things as a [webfont generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) exists. Simply upload the font you want to have, download the files and implement them into your website.  

**Important:** Be aware (as in every publishment) that you need to have the permission to use this font! Otherwise the generators will not generate the fonts for you or even worse you will have to pay a high fee for using the font.

To prevent all of this above just go to [Google fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts). They have a lot of fonts that are free to use and already prepared to use on your website. Of course they maybe do not have the exact font you wanted to use, but maybe a font that is very similar to it and it is free! So no worries about compatibility or using permissions.

### The inspector

Especially by doing the exercises, you must have got that rebuilding websites without any information is very complicated. Of course you could have a look into the source code and see in there what properties you need. Often that is very difficult to find the exact value you need, because the code does not have to be very tidy.  

Fortunately again some developers had been aware of that issue as well and now there is a tool implemented in every browser called **inspector**. With this tool you simply click on the element you want to get information about and the CSS properties will just plop up for you. Give it a try!
