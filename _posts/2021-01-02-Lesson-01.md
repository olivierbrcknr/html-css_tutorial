### What is HTML? What do we use it for? And what is the difference between HTML and CSS?

So, to understand a website, we have to know how it is built. A website usually contains a lot of different files that all work together. Each file, therefore, has its purpose. The most important file is (you may have guessed it) the `.html` file.

The `.html` file includes all the information on a website. One could say the content. In comparison, the `.css` file contains information about the layout or the design. Like the `.js` file, other files contain other specific information.

If you see a website without any CSS data, it just looks white with some blue text. I guess you saw sites like this before. That means, without any CSS, any site somehow only looks the same, regardless if it is “Google,” “Twitter,” or “Wikipedia.” The style sheet defines the look. To better understand what that means, you should look at [this site](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Here you always have the same `.html` file but different `.css` ones. Clicking on the menu items, you can test all the other layouts without changing the content.

<div class="multiImages">

{% include lazyload.html image_src="website_html.svg" image_alt="Website HTML Mock-Up" subtitle="Only HTML" class="invertIfDark" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="website_css.svg" image_alt="Website HTML Mock-Up" subtitle="HTML and CSS" class="invertIfDark" %}

</div>

### But what is HTML?

HTML stands for _hypertext markup language_[^1]. It is not a programming language, more like specific content. Think of it like you wanted to explain to your grandma on the phone how a printed paper is structured: "At first there ist this big headline Introduction in HTML', then there is another smaller one and then there is a paragraph with a lot of text…"

So this is how HTML code looks like:

```html
Here is a text with a <a href="http://website.com">link</a> and an <u>underlined</u> section.
```

### How does it work?

You build HTML with _tags_. Each tag usually consists of the command you want to pass within greater-than `<` and less-than signs `>`, clutching the content you want to modify. The command is usually straightforward and often describes what you want to do. E.g., a paragraph is `p`, something that you want to have <u>underlined</u> is `u`, and something that you want to have **bold** is `b`. So, in conclusion, if you’re going to write something bold, you should write the command before and after the word you want to write bold: `<b>bold text</b>, not bold text`. Keep in mind the slash `/` symbol in the closing tag!

Some tags, like a _link_, contain _attributes_ within their commands. Here you can include information that should be invisible to the user. E.g., if you write a link, you do not want the user to see the whole URL, as it would destroy the flow of reading. Instead, we can tell the website that one word should refer to the URL. We do that using the `href` attribute[^2]. A link would then look like this: `<a href=”https://github.com/”>this is a link</a>`.

That’s mostly it! You can write a whole text with paragraphs, different headlines, tables, lists, images, and of course, links just using HTML.[^3] Now, you only need to know what commands to use for the specific things you want to do!

### Common commands:

#### For text:

|`<p></p>`          |Paragraph               |
|`<h1></h1>`        |Headlines (from 1 to 6) |
|`<b></b>`          |bold                    |
|`<i></i>`          |italic                  |
|`<u></u>`          |underline               |
|`<a href=""></a>`  |link with target        |

#### Single tags:

|`<br/>`         |break (new line)|
|`<hr/>`         |thematic break  |
|`<img src="" />`|image (+ source)|

#### Lists:

|`<ul></ul>`|unordered list (dots)|
|`<ol></ol>`|ordered list (numbers)|
|`<li></li>`|list element|

### Commenting

Very useful for coding is it to comment on things. Commenting is a way to write something in your code without having it displayed on the actual website. Commenting helps you know what you have coded and why, so I propose you get familiar with commenting.

Every programming or coding language, unfortunately, has its own commenting command. In HTML, it also needs to clasp the comment and looks like this:

```html
<!-- a comment -->
```

### How is a HTML file set up?

At the very beginning of the file, you need to tell the browser what to expect. We do that using this tag:[^4]

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

Generally, an HTML file consists of two parts: The `<head>` and the `<body>`. The **head** contains the elements that should be invisible to the user but are important for the browser, like the character set you are using or the website title, which is visible in the tab or browser window title. It usually looks something like this:

```html
<head>
	<title>My awesome website</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
```

The **body** contains the content that should be visible to the user. Here goes the actual content you want to display.


### Try it yourself!

Just use a simple text editor, e.g., “TextEdit” on macOS, create a file, name it `index.html`, and try out some simple commands! Be careful to save it as “raw text.” It could look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
	<title>My awesome website</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8" />
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>

	<p>
		This is my very first attempt in writing some HTML code. I can write <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> texts.
	</p>

	<h2>A list with music I like:<h2>
	
	<ul>
    <li>The Acid</li>
    <li>Badbadnotgood</li>
    <li>Laura Misch</li>
	</ul>
</body>
```

When you are done, simply open the file in a browser you like (e.g., Google Chrome) and have a look at the result.
