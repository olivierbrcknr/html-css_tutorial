### What is HTML? What do we use it for? And what is the difference between HTML and CSS?

So, to understand a website, we have to understand how it is built. A website usually contains a lot of different files that all work together. Each file therefore has its own purpose. The most important file is (you may have guessed it) the `.html` file.

The .html file contains all the information in a website, you could say the content. In comparison the `.css` file contains the information about the layout or the design. Other files, like the `.js` file contain information about moving parts and `.jpg` files about images.

If you see a website without any css data it just looks like white with some blue text. I guess, you saw sites like this before. That means, any site somehow just looks the same, without any css data, regardless if it is google, facebook or wikipedia. The css defines the look. To understand better what that means you should have a look at [this site](http://www.csszengarden.com/). Here you always have the same .html file but different .css ones. Clicking on the different links you can see the all different layouts without changing the content.

<div class="multiImages">

{% include lazyload.html image_src="website_html.svg" image_alt="Website HTML Mock-Up" subtitle="Only HTML" class="invertIfDark" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="website_css.svg" image_alt="Website HTML Mock-Up" subtitle="HTML and CSS" class="invertIfDark" %}

</div>

### But what is HTML actually?

HTML stands for _hypertext markup language_[^1]. Do not think of it as a programming language, more like if you want to explain someone how a text looks like. Think of it like you wanted to explain your grandma on the phone how a printed paper is structured: "At first there ist this big headline 'Lesson 1: Introduction in HTML', then there is another smaller one and then there is a paragraph with a lot of textâ€¦"

So this is how HTML code looks like:

```html
Here is a text with a <a href="http://website.com">link</a> and an <u>underlined</u> section.
```

### How does it work?

Actually you always have the braces to define a command in HTML. The command is very simple and often describes in between one to three letters what you want to do. E.g. a paragraph is `p`, something that you want to have <u>underlined</u> is `u` and something that you want to have **bold** is `b`. If you want to write something bold you should write the command before and after the word you want to write bold: `<b>bold text</b>, not bold text`.

Actually this is mostly it! You can write a whole text with paragraphs, different headlines, tables, lists, images and of course links just using HTML. Now you only need to know what commands to use for the specific things you want to do!

### Common commands:

#### For text:

|`<p></p>`          |Paragraph               |
|`<h1></h1>`        |Headlines (from 1 to 6) |
|`<b></b>`          |bold                    |
|`<i></i>`          |italic                  |
|`<u></u>`          |underline               |
|`<a href=""></a>`  |link with target        |

#### No closing tag needed:

|`<br/>`         |break (new line)|
|`<hr/>`         |thematic break  |
|`<img src="" />`|image (+ source)|

#### Lists:

|`<ul></ul>`|unordered list (dots)|
|`<ol></ol>`|ordered list (numbers)|
|`<li></li>`|list element|

### Commenting

Very useful for coding is it to comment things. Commenting is a way to write something in your code without having it displayed on the actual website. Commenting helps you to know later on what you have written and why, so I propose you should get familiar with commenting.

If you want to comment something you always have to use a special "command" in each language. In HTML it looks like this:

### Try it yourself!

Just use a simple text editor, create a file, name it `index.html` and try out some of the simple commands! It could look like this:

```html
<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>
    This is my very first attempt in writing some HTML code. I can write <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> texts.
</p>

<h2>A list with music I like:<h2>

<ul>
    <li>The Acid</li>
    <li>Badbadnotgood</li>
    <li>Laura Misch</li>
</ul>
```

If you are done, simply open the file in a browser you like (e.g. Google Chrome) and look at the result.
