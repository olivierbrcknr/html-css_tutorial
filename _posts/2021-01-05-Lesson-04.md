### Just Simple Boxes

With [lesson 1](#lesson-01), you got to know basic HTML, and with lessons 2 and 3, you got the primary and most essential commands in CSS. Mostly everything you need to know to build websites on your own.

But why does it not look like typical websites? What is missing? To understand that, we have to look at how websites are structured.

You may have noticed that every object in the last examples and exercises is very rectangular, especially regarding the CSS code, e.g. `width`, `height`, `margin-left`, and `padding-right`. All the commands specify only the four regular directions of a rectangle.

If you look at other websites, you will realize that every website is made entirely out of these rectangular shapes or **boxes**.

### Organizing Our Drawer

Okay, but what is so special about those _boxes_ now? Actually, nothing. You just have to get used to the way to layout with them. You always have to put a box inside a box inside a box to get the specific design you want to have. E.g., you have a big box, your website, and inside that box, you have another one representing the _head_ of your website—let's say an intro image and name of your site. After that, you have another box, your actual content, inside which are two more boxes, one with your _article_ maybe and next to it is one containing your _navigation_. In your actual content box, there are some with images, some with possibly other articles. And so on and so on.

{% include lazyload.html image_src="website_boxes.svg" image_alt="box model" subtitle="this is how a website is built up" class="invertIfDark" %}

This sounds a bit confusing at the beginning but think of it as a large drawer you have and want to organize. You put in some big boxes, let's say for your writing material, and you put in smaller boxes, e.g., for paperclips, in those big ones to give them even more structure.

### The `div` Layer

Your question might now be: “How can I build those boxes?” You did it all the time! Every HTML tag builds a box. But all of them have a specific purpose. You know the `<p></p>` tag, for example, is for writing a paragraph. But is there something for an empty, not predefined box? And of course, there is!

This special tag is the `<div></div>` element.[^1]

And this is the part where the classes come into the spotlight. To give those div layers a purpose, you can give them specific classes and parameters to declare their function for your website. E.g., you could have a div layer with the class "main" in which you describe your main content area’s values. The same you could do for a “navigation” and the actual “content.”

Now you write the "boxes" into each other like you want to arrange them. Clasp the boxes you want to contain with the tags of the box you want it to be contained, like the HTML-tags of a paragraph clasp the Text of your paragraph.

```html
<div class="main">

    <div class="navigation">

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="/home.html">
                    Home
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/about.html">
                    About
                </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="/work.html">
                    Work
                </a>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <h2>
            The headline of my amazing content.
        </h2>
        <!-- Some content -->
    </div>
</div>
```


### Columns, or `flex-box` and `grid`

It is relatively clear how to structure websites piece-by-piece, layer-by-layer, but how can we layout columns? We can use the `flex` property to create more complex layouts.[^2]


### The Hashtag

One more thing regarding HTML and CSS is using IDs. IDs work exactly the same way as classes do. The only different thing is that it is called “ID.”

But while classes are used for multiple elements, an ID should be used for **only one specific** element. E.g., you have numerous div-layers that are used as visible boxes, but one of those fungates as your header element, and therefore, you want to give it the unique ID: "header.”

Like the classes overwrite the usual HTML tags, an ID even overwrites the classes’ pieces of information. That is the hierarchy your browser reads out the information in CSS:

1.  ID
2.  Class
3.  HTML tag
4.  Inherited from the parent element

### How do I add values to those IDs?

As I mentioned, it is basically like classes, except that you do not use a `.` but a `#` instead. Here is how it could look like in your code:

```html
<!-- HTML file -->
<div id="header">
My website's header.
</div>
```

```css
/* CSS file */
#header {
background: #bdc3c7;
}
```

### Those Annoying CSS Presets

What you probably have realized is that each HTML tag already has some style values. Thus you have some `margins` or `font-sizes` where you do not want them, and you need to figure out at first where which values are pre-given.

To get rid of those presets, you can simply add a `.css` file that just resets all those pre-given values, allowing you to (really) start from scratch! Of course, some people did this as well, so you do not have to write this file yourself. Simply download [this `reset.css`](https://gist.github.com/DavidWells/18e73022e723037a50d6) file and implement it in between your `<head></head>` tags—like you would do with your regular CSS file mentioned in [lesson 2](#lesson-02). But be careful to put it before your regular file; otherwise, your styles will be overwritten by the reset file, resetting your code!

[^1]: There are even more empty boxes that inherit semantic values, which get important when you intend to improve your website for search engines (SEO), such as `header`, `footer`, `nav`, and `article`. You can find all of them [here](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp).
