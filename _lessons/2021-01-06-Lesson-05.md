### Domain, Webspace, Hosting — What do I have to do?

Everyone always talks about creating websites, but how do we actually publish them? You are probably all aware that a *domain* is a relatively good start (you know, that thingy with the `.com` or so at the top of your browser). Good! So we got one (for example [here](https://iwantmyname.com/) or most of the time with your webspace as well) and now what? Let’s start at the beginning.

Think of a website as your apartment. Every apartment has a location, the actual room in which you put your furniture in. This is the *webspace*.[^1] It is the online server that stores and hosts your website. You could go there if you would know the exact latitude and longitude (this would be the IP), but that is not a very helpful way to tell your friends where to go for the next pizza party. We use an address: a street, number, zip code, etc. That’s what the domain actually is. It is simply the address of your website, an alternate name of the location. Without the apartment, the address is quite useless and without the address, the apartment is hard to find. This address is also helpful to receive mail (aka _email_, duhh..).

Ok, we have the room, address on it, nice! So it’s time to move. Collecting our furniture (the code we are writing here, so the `.html` and `.css` files) and making our new home cozy. But how can we actually put the furniture from the storage van (your computer) to the apartment? We get help from a moving company. It’s called [*FTP*](https://cyberduck.io/) (_file transfer protocol_). It helps us to transfer all the pieces to the server. Just insert your credentials (you will get them from your web hoster) and you are ready to upload your files!

The last bit to know is that the first info a browser searches—somehow the “welcome” mat of our apartment—is the `index.html` file. This file in the `root` (so in the first level of your server, not in a folder) is opened if nothing different is specified.

### Talking about time

When it comes to actually building websites, a lot of data, e.g., images, are needed. All of you should be aware of how much storage space images can take on your hard-drive. When it comes to websites, this problem gets even worse.

We all have been on a website that took longer than a couple of milliseconds to load and then probably thought: "Naahhh, I won't have a look on this one then.” You might say a couple of seconds is not that much, but try it out yourself. It will seem like an eternity to you!  

But why are taking some websites so much longer? You know the answer already, of course. Too much data! It takes some time for the browser to download and read everything. The more data the browser has to get, the longer it takes.

Indeed, the provider’s speed, your internet connection, and many other factors have something to say here as well, but in the end, we want to make a website appealing for everyone, so we try to make it as small as possible.

### What is about the right size?

Connections get faster and faster with time, which means the acceptable size of websites increases continuously. But to get this straight, when talking about sizes, we do not speak about gigabytes—we do not even talk about a high number of megabytes. An average website should have not more than **4 MB** these days,[^1] and even that is a high value! (Just to get an impression, _this_ website has less than 200 KB.)

### That is impossible!

It is not! As you might know, there are many websites around the internet, and all of them keep their size very low. You might wonder how they get websites smaller than even one of those images you wanted to implement into your layout?

Therefore some tools are existing to shrink down the size of your images. _Adobe Photoshop_ for example, has the function “save for web,” using this feature, you can save images in the exact size, quality, and format you need, so it shrinks to the lowest possible size.

I also recommend the tool “ImageOptim,” which efficiently minimizes the kilobytes of images. I usually run all my images through the software before uploading them. You can access it [here](https://imageoptim.com/).

Here is an example what difference this could make:

<div class="multiImages">
{% include lazyload.html image_src="rotterdam.jpg" image_alt="Rotterdam" subtitle="An image in its original size. 3,5 MB" %}

{% include lazyload.html image_src="rotterdam_web.jpg" image_alt="Rotterdam Web" subtitle="The same image shrank down to a width of 600px and saved for web. 0,13 MB" %}
</div>

If you download both images, you will realize that the one on the right is way smaller in pixel and data size, but—compared to print—the visitor will not see the difference unless they download the image. Or would you have seen the difference in those pictures above? In most cases, we do not need or want the user to download the image, so why adding it in this big size?

Sometimes it is necessary to add big pictures or a lot of them. For those reasons, it is good to implement javascript files, such as [lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload). With such scripts, the images will get loaded when needed and not in advance. Therefore, the initial load will get a lot smaller. 

### The different formats

Using the function “save for web” in _Photoshop_, you get the option between `.jpg`, `.png` and `.gif.` I assume you have heard of all of these formats. But do you know which to use when? Are there differences, and if so, which?  

First of all, look at what you want to achieve with your image. Does it need a transparent background? Should it move? Depending on what you need, you should use a specific format. There are a couple of these. Here I listed up when to use which one:

In most cases, you should use the `.jpg` format. It is the overall standard for all pictures. If you save it as a `.jpg`, you will not have transparency or movement, but a minimal size and good quality. You can even shrink down the quality to `80%` without losing too much from the image, saving you again around half of the image data size.

If you need transparent parts, e.g., a cut-out object in front of your colorful background, you should use the `.png` format. It allows you to have an additional _alpha_ value for each pixel. It does not change much for your workflow, but it adds up a couple of kilobytes.

The latest use of the internet showed us many those moving memes and the war about the pronunciation of the `.gif`. But for designing, it is only important to know that this format allows you to have a small sequence of images. It is important to know that each frame gives the final "image" a lot of extra data! Therefore, the `.gif` format is the biggest—they often get even multiple megabytes by only using three images. I just would propose to use as few gifs as possible. 

I would even recommend using videos (`.mp4`) instead. The syntax for videos is a little different than for images. It looks like this:

```html
<video>
<source src="myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

### One more type

Especially in times of _responsive web design_, images that are endlessly scalable are critical. You are familiar with such files: These vector files we work with all the time in _Adobe Illustrator_ for example.

You can save files in different formats out of such programs, e.g., `.ai`, `.dxf` or `.pdf`, but there is one format that you probably read a lot but never cared this much about: `.svg`. Browsers can also read this format. It has multiple benefits: It is super small in storage, and it has no scale limit! But you can only use it—as all the shapes in Illustrator—with overall fill colors and not images. It is perfect for icons or logos.

### How should I name my files?

By doing the last exercises, you probably got an impression of how annoying it is to write the <u>exact</u> name of a file, so it is readable by the browser. It is essential to name your documents and images the right way not to run into even more problems. 
 
Especially in languages like German or Swedish, some of these unique letters like “ü,” “ö,” or “å.” Computers do not like those, meaning you should avoid them. But what is even more annoying, computers do not like _spaces_ as well! Your operating system has a well-thought-through code to prevent this problem, but unfortunately, the web and browsers often have not. Therefore you should replace all your spacings with underscores `_` or minus `-` symbols.  

Another part is that some of your code languages look at the different spellings with capitals and other languages do not. Therefore I would propose to avoid using _capitals_ as well.  

Also, try to avoid _dots_. Nowadays, it should not be a problem anymore, but I always try to stay safe and not use them in names if some old browsers might have some troubles. But now that should finally be it!  

Here is an example of how an image should be named: `rotterdam_gruen_08-29-2015.jpg`.

### How to locate them?

Now that you can write websites from scratch, it probably gets essential to know how to locate files only using text, the **URL**.

Every time you wanted to link to a specific file, you usually wrote down the name of the file, because it was in the same folder, or you just copied a link out of your browser, looking like this: `<a href="http://google.com">My Link</a>`.

If you want to keep your files in a better structure using folders, you only need to add your folder’s name to this link. Let's say you have your HTML file in some directory, and in the same folder as your HTML file, you have the folder "images" in which you have that amazing picture of your cat: "mr_snuggles.jpg." Now you write into your code of your `img` tag the folder as well, looking like this: `<img src="images/mr_snuggles.jpg" />`.  

If you have something in a folder further above the one you are actually in with your file referring to, you simply add two dots, e.g. `<a href="../home.html">Home</a>`. 
 
That is the way you navigate to files! Always keep in mind which file you are in right now and how often you need to step one folder back or which folder further in. That can be as complex as you want: `<a href="../../works/year_one/portfolio.html">That is my portfolio</a>`.

Referring to some other website, you add the `https://`. This snippet tells your browser to look into the world wide web and then the next directory. Your browser will think the file you are linking to is on the same directory as your website without these letters.  

By just using the slash symbol (`/`) in an URL, your browser will start at the very first folder of your server. If you try this on a local file somewhere—e.g., on your desktop—it might confuse you, but this link would go to your hard drive of your computer and you would have to navigate to your desktop like shown before.
  
Therefore, I propose always using relative paths (referring to the file you are in and then dots or folders). Only use the absolute when it is impossible to use relative paths.

### More than Comic Sans

Now that we talked about images and naming stuff, you probably want to know how to add other fonts than just those few save web fonts like “Verdana” or “Times New Roman.” As I wrote in the paragraph above, computers—and especially browsers—are very dumb and stubborn. Each browser has its format, and therefore you need to provide the font-face in every format to your website. Afterward, you need to tell your CSS file which files belong to the font.

In CSS3 there is a new function for implementing fonts, called `@font-face`. So how does it work? Here is an example:

```css
@font-face {
	/* Here the name is defined we later use in our CSS. */
	font-family: "Source Code Pro";
	/* Then we add the files needed actually containing the font. */
	src: url("fonts/SourceCodePro.eot");
	src: url("fonts/SourceCodePro.eot?#iefix") format('embedded-opentype'),
	     url("fonts/SourceCodePro.woff") format("woff"),
	     url("fonts/SourceCodePro.ttf") format("truetype"),
	     url("fonts/SourceCodePro.svg") format("svg");
	/* Here we tell the browser what weight and style the font is. */
	font-weight: normal;
	font-style: normal;
}
```

Because exporting the font in all these different formats and implementing it for every font style is very annoying, cool tools such as a [webfont generator](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator) exist. Simply upload the font you want to have, download the files, and implement them into your website.  

**Important:** Be aware (as in every publishment) that you need **to have permission** to use this font! Otherwise, the generators will not generate the fonts for you, or even worse, you will have to pay a high fine for using the font.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) has many fonts free to use and are already prepared to use on your website. Of course, they maybe do not have the exact font you wanted to use, but perhaps a font that is very similar to it, and it is free! So no worries about compatibility or using permissions.

### The inspector

When doing the exercises, you must have realized that rebuilding websites without any information is very complicated. Of course, you could look into the source code and see in there what properties you need, but often the website’s code is messy and massive, making it hard to find what you are looking for.

Fortunately, some developers had been aware of that issue as well, and there is a tool implemented in every browser called “inspector.” With this tool, you simply click on the element you want to get information about, and the CSS properties will just plop up for you. Usually, the key combination to open it is: `cmd + option + i` (macOS) or `ctrl + alt + i` (Windows). Give it a try!

[^1]: There are soooo many web hosters. It differs from the region (e.g. EU vs the USA), pricing, and so on. Check for yourself, I would say every host provides for everything you need. **Do not get fooled by the storage size! You do not need much!** Maybe [this list](https://websitesetup.org/best-web-hosting-sites/) helps.
