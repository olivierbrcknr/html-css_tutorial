# Lesson 4: The box model

Download and look at the template I made in [`02_template/index.html`](02_template/index.html) in your browser. Then open the file [`03_task/index.html`](03_task/index.html) in your browser and [`03_task/style.css`](03_task/style.css) in your text editor and try rebuilding my template site. A

Build the `.html` file from scratch, use everything you know. Use as many div layers as you need. Also add classes and IDs in the `.css` file. Some I already have pre-written for you. You will not need more HTML tags than those that I already put in the `.css` file. Copy the texts from the [`02_template/stroke.html`](02_template/stroke.html) file, but open it in your browser to not directly see all the code ;)

Then open the file [`03_task/stroke_task.html`](03_task/stroke_task.html) and [`03_task/style.css`](03_task/style.css) in your browser and text editor and try to rebuild my template site.

Here are some hints:

```css
/* Font-family I used: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;
Colors I used: #bdc3c7, #ecf0f1, #1abc9c */

/* Some examples of what you could need: */
#wrapper {
width: 960px;
}
.container { 
  display: flex;
}
```

If you have problems with the new commands or how IDs work, have a look at the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bIoJiGnZAuuvxtQw0-AJLykoJ1247n1W4968lNsGYoc/edit?usp=sharing) or at the [`01_example/example.html`](01_example/example.html) and the [`01_example/style.css`](01_example/style.css) files, there I explained everything again within the comments.

I hope you don't have too many problems rebuilding everything. If you have, don't hesitate to ask me!
