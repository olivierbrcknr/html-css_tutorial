	<h2>Every Website is built out of boxes. These boxes are called div-layers.</h2>

	<div class="box">
		This text is inside a div layer, which has the class "box".
		The class box has CSS values for margin, padding, width and
		background-color.
	</div>

	<div class="box" id="dark">
		This div-layer has the same class as the div above, but has additionally
		the id "dark" with a darker background. The ID overwrites the value of
		the class.
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		Inside a div layer we add a new div layer with a new class.
		<div class="inner">
			And so on, and so on,...
			<div class="inner">
				<div class="inner">

				</div>
			</div>
			Of course you can add multiplte layers on the same level. Depending on
			yout layout.
			<div class="inner">

			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

  <p>
    The three boxes in this div layer have a class that gives them a specifc width
    but they are still dispalyed below each other even though it would be possible to
    align them next to each other.
  </p>

	<div class="box">

		<div class="column">

		</div>
		<div class="column">

		</div>
		<div class="column">

		</div>
	</div>

  <p>
    Here we have the same container and div layers within, but we give the container also the property of "display: flex". Now the elements are displayed in columns
  </p>

	<div class="box multiColumns">

		<div class="column">

		</div>
		<div class="column">

		</div>
		<div class="column">

		</div>
	</div>
