	<h2>Every Website is built out of boxes. These boxes are called div-layers.</h2>

	<div class="box">
		This text is inside a div layer, which has the class "box".
		The class box has CSS values for margin, padding, width and 
		background-color.
	</div>

	<div class="box" id="dark">
		This div-layer has the same class as the div above, but has additionally 
		the id "dark" with a darker background. The ID overwrites the value of 
		the class.
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		Inside a div layer we add a new div layer with a new class.
		<div class="inner">
			And so on, and so on,...
			<div class="inner">
				<div class="inner">

				</div>
			</div>
			Of course you can add multiplte layers on the same level. Depending on 
			yout layout.
			<div class="inner">
				
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		The three boxes in this div layer have a class that gives them a width
		but they are still showed below each other even if it is possible to 
		align them next to each other.
		<div class="noleft">

		</div>
		<div class="noleft">

		</div>
		<div class="noleft">

		</div>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p>Inside this div layer we have the same multiple div-layer with the class 
		"left". This class gives these boxes the CSS value "float: left;" which 
		alows the boxes to align next to each other.<br>
		When we are done using the float command we have to tell the browser that it
		is done. Therefore we built the class "clear" with the CSS value "clear:both;"</p>
		<div class="left">

		</div>
		<div class="left">

		</div>
		<div class="left">

		</div>
		<div class="clear"></div>
	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p>If we do not add this last div layer, our layout will get destroyed.</p>
		<div class="left">
