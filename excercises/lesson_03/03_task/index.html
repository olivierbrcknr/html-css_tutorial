	<h1>How Lego Built the Coolest Company in the World</h1>
	<h3>With a hit movie, licensing tie-ins, and constant innovation, everything is awesome at Lego. But it all starts with the magic that happens when a kid snaps two bricks together.</h3>

		When he disappears, he disappears behind the walnut door to his room—the door, it seems, must always be closed to seal him in his private capsule—and then there's the sound of banging and rummaging in the closet, the padding of feet, and the sudden jangly spill of Lego bricks. And that's it. We won't see him for two, three, four hours. He doesn't eat, he doesn't drink. We'll crack the door to make sure he's alive, and there in that slim line of light we can see the crown of his head bowed in concentration. His hands read the pieces off the floor like Braille, without his eyes having to see, and a flying machine suddenly materializes, or the minifigures amass for battle or celebration. Often he is making it up as he goes, talking to this world in low, sweet tones. Until the enemy arrives, or the monsters. Then his voice gets growly and a war ensues with the shattering of brick, one of the dangerous costs of believing in the permanence of your own self-made utopia. He is teaching himself a great deal about this world of ours, things we can't teach him ourselves. So—we retreat. He builds more. Dinner now, we call five times. And again. When he emerges, he's spent but smiling, half-here. He pushes a pea around his plate, eats nothing. When it's over, and he's cleared his dishes, he pads quickly back upstairs, the door bumps shut, another jangle of sound, the colored bricks, and he's gone again.

	<h2>
		But where?
	</h2>

	<p>
		<b>So let this be a story about trying to find my son</b>, and a whole lot of other kids, young and old, wherever they go, behind the walnut door. And let it begin in a storage closet in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, New York, with a massive yellow duck. It's a mini monster, this duck, almost exactly like Ernie's rubber ducky from <i>Sesame Street,</i> but made out of nearly 25,000 Lego bricks&mdash;and the size of a Shetland pony. When I first saw it, when I came face to face with its peaceable expression of innocent no-thought and its adorable citrine bill, I couldn't help myself: I blurted out a laugh. More like an inadvertent snort, then laughter. <i>Who would ever think to make such a thing</i>? The answer was Sean Kenney, a youthful 38-year-old maker with reddish hair and blue eyes. In fact, up until the duck moment, I'd been having a somewhat serious conversation with Kenney about his lifelong obsession with Lego bricks and, more specifically, about how, in his work as a Lego artist and entrepreneur, his medium&mdash;these bricks&mdash;seemed so primitive and regressive, well &hellip; so <i>childlike</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		But underneath, of course, I was also wondering:<i>Why</i>? Why was this nearly middle-aged man still playing—or <i>getting</i> to play—with Lego bricks?
	</p>

	<p>
		"A lot of us makers are just trying to do something that's never been seen before."
	</p>

	<p>
		Kenney didn't disagree with the bricks being childlike. He wouldn't even call himself an artist, as he feels he's still playing after thirty-something years. When asked at what age he first began messing around with Lego bricks, there was no hesitation. His earliest memory of life itself was at 2 in a New Jersey suburb, surrounded by a loving family (his dad a rabid DIYer), on the floor with them: the rainbow colors, the feel, the satisfying interlocking click. He was like a bionic person half made of Lego bricks. Or his psyche was. On his website he calls himself a professional kid. What was <i>that</i>? And where might the rest of us sign up?
	</p>
	<p>
		And yet right here before my eyes was visible proof that Kenney wasn't some sort of Pee-wee Herman: this gargantuan rubber ducky, retailing for a staggering $39,000. "I compare it to getting your car fixed," Kenney said. "It's never the parts that cost that much, it's the labor."
	</p>
	<p>
		What Kenney was so good at describing, besides this world he'd created for himself, the one in which he spends every hour of the workday behind the door of his studio assembling huge Lego models (eight-foot hummingbirds and life-size polar bears, or making little Lego lamps with the help of eleven hired assistants), what so few can put into words when it comes to the iconic building toy, is the strange thing that happens with the accrual of rectangular bricks (yellow rubber duckies! eight-foot hummingbirds!) and how evidence of these strange things can be found everywhere in plain sight when you begin to really pay attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I think a lot of us makers are just trying to do something that's never been seen before," Kenney said. "Sometimes we're doing it just for each other, to inspire each other. It's like a conversation. How far can you push it? Can you surprise even yourself?"
	</p>

	<p>
		I knew something about surprise, for in pursuing this story, I'd already bumped into a six-foot simulacrum of Mark Twain made out of Lego bricks in Hartford, Connecticut, and a life-size Queen Elizabeth II (in snowy palette) and Prince William (in regal red and royal blue) built from the same in London. I had met a young guy—another maker—who kept building bigger and bigger robotic models, just for fun, until he was hired by various companies at the age of 24 to model factories out of Lego bricks before the companies went ahead and built them for real. And I'd bedded down in a Lego-themed hotel at Legoland in Billund, Denmark, where in the lobby there was a massive, Smaug-like Lego dragon, a Darth Vader, and Stormtroopers, and where at breakfast there was such a happy crush of rampaging runtlings, all ricocheting around with primitive Lego creations in hand, you could scarcely reach the pastry table.
	</p>

	<p>
		Along the way, too, my son—the one who'd spent his boyhood behind that walnut door building with Legos but who was now 14 and seemingly outgrowing the toy—came with me to Billund, where the bricks were first manufactured in 1949, and for the better part of a week he forwent his increasingly exciting social life and constructed stuff out of Lego bricks again. After returning home, while sifting through some old boxes, I came upon a lost photo of my son with a Lego skyscraper he'd made when he was 9, a simple tower nearly seven feet tall, him beaming just as he had when he'd shown me a spacecraft he'd built with wings and a control room a few days earlier, in our pirate-themed room in Legoland.
	</p>

	<p>
		The same expression, the same boy.
	</p>

	<p>
		[...]
	</p>

	<p>
		It's said there are about a hundred bricks per person on earth.
	</p>

	<p>
		"People will tell you they have their own path to playing with Legos," said Michael McNally, a company spokesman. "Everybody has different sets. I began with Legoland, the town, and I love Lego Architecture. Someone else loves <i>Star Wars</i>. Or Mindstorms. People like to talk about the infinite with this system, but it's also very limited because [the brick] is a rigid geometric form. So the idea that you can look at something finite and see infinite possibilities in it, and believe you can make something round out of it even though it's square, is very hard to explain. I think in other cultures we might have rounded the edges because someone wanted them round, but I think there's something to this idea of discipline and restraint that almost liberates these forms. Lego bricks can be anything you imagine them to be. That's really their appeal."
	</p>

	<p>
		[...]
	</p>

	<p>
		During my visit to world headquarters, in Billund, I repeatedly met with people—make that employees who've made Lego bricks their life work—who also struggle to understand the exact algorithm for the brick's ubiquity. Headquarters here are modest-looking, low-slung buildings made mostly of yellowish brick, and because the town is so sleepy, many of the employees commute up to an hour each way from bigger towns. The company culture is decidedly unpretentious—and employees really do seem to subscribe to the 11 Paradoxes of Management listed on a placard hung in every Lego manager's office, these three, among others, calling for individuals "to be a visionary—and to keep both feet firmly on the ground. To be self-confident—and humble. To take the lead—and to recede into the background."

		Lego clearly isn't an oblivious collective of elves making a magic toy. "This is our heart and soul," said Roar Rude Trangbæk, Lego press officer, while giving me a tour of the factory, a fully modern, automated, fifteen-acre warehouse replete with 750 of the latest versions of that old Windsor SH Plastic Moulding Machine. Working off computers, the machines purred in a low hum, fed by pipes teeming with ABS pellets. When heated and liquefied, the material fills a mold, cools to its particular shape, and then is ejected in that jangle of color, cheap jewels filling bins until they're swept away by robots, destined for whatever particular set will excite its clamoring fans or offer complete satiation on Christmas morning. But even in its unceasing production, the Lego brick is animated by ten tenets, first codified by Godtfred in 1963. It seems a lot to put on a piece of plastic, but in boiled-down corporate bites these are:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Unlimited play potential</li>
		<li>For girls and for boys</li>
		<li>Fun for every age</li>
		<li>Year-round play</li>
		<li>Healthy, quiet play</li>
		<li>Long hours of play</li>
		<li>Development, imagination, creativity</li>
		<li>The more Lego, the greater the value</li>
		<li>Extra sets available</li>
		<li>Quality in every detail</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		In the conversations that ensued at world headquarters, I noticed some recurring themes: Most employees claimed an early love for playing with Lego bricks (that they, too, were the boy or girl behind the walnut door); evoked their bosses, the Kristiansen family, with glowing, if slightly cultish, praise; emphasized the low-key, inclusive company philosophy that continues to highlight the educational rewards of playing with Lego bricks; and spoke to the need for corporate secrecy regarding future plans and ongoing research ("We don't necessarily feel we're competing with other toys or games," said one employee, but he clamped shut when asked with whom or what Lego was competing, then); and ended each conversation somewhere between the twenty-third and thirtieth minute with a somewhat brusque insistence on how busy they were. At a company in forward motion, and with pressure to produce during the relatively sane number of hours in the Danish workday, there seemed little time for floaty reflection or declarative me-statements here. The folks at world headquarters are happy to leave that up to others. Meanwhile everything's on an egg timer, and you can almost hear the sucking sound of an incredibly lucrative enterprise needing their attention to maximize profit. If there was a disappointment, at least for me, it was that, except for the designers, none of the adults here seem to have any real time to play.
	</p>

	<p>
		Afterward, several Lego employees asked me if I'd cried on my visit there
	</p>

	<p>
		At one point, back at the Idea House, I was led into what the Lego people call the Archive, but it might best pass as the Stacks of Past Memory. These are huge, hand-cranked bookshelves, more or less divvied up by decade, containing almost every Lego set ever made. It's an astonishing thing, really, and some of the most obscure kits were bought on eBay. Found down here are the first Lego Mursten (or Building Bricks), and the Big Town set from 1961, and the automated Lego train and Lego Space from the 1970s. The stacks from the eighties and nineties bring an assortment of Duplo products (the bigger Lego brick) and Lego Mindstorms, while the 2000s lean more heavily on the action figures and movie tie-ins, from the Vikings sets to the Harry Potter set scenes. And let there be no doubt, somewhere in this plastic cornucopia is the game or set that once belonged to you too.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's said that people get lost in the Archive for hours. In fact, afterward, several Lego employees asked me if I'd cried on my visit there. (I hadn't, but when my son came upon the Millennium Falcon in the 2000s stack, the first big Lego kit he ever completed on his own, he gave a little yelp of joy.) They asked because either they themselves had—or they'd heard the many poignant stories of others who, when confronted with the Lego set of their youth, had had a sort of <i>Wild Strawberries</i> moment, powerfully recollecting the hours spent lost in the pure pleasure of this particular kit or remembering the person by whose hand they'd been given the gift … and then they'd found themselves absolutely overcome by this wave of strange joy/sadness, or grief/elation, or whatever it was that only a simple, infinite plastic brick could mysteriously evoke in a person reaching backwards in time for something there/not there, namely his childhood.

		<b>A few weeks later, back on this side of the ocean</b>, I took a New England road trip. At each stop—at MIT's Media Lab to meet with renowned educator Mitchel Resnick, at the bustling Lego Model Shop in Enfield, Connecticut, and in New York City, hive of Lego makers—I was met with a blast of effusion. Though I was talking to grownups, it felt over and over again as if I were entering through the door of some geeked-out kid's room, one towering with Lego inventions and scattered bricks everywhere and the breathless monomania of perpetual youth. There was something in the primitivism of it all, the clicking bricks and blocky figures, the sophistication and simplicity, the splendor and rusticity that links the present and the past, that created some deeper disturbance of comfort.
	</p>

	<p>
		Situated near the Charles River in Cambridge, Massachusetts, MIT's Media Lab is a glass-and-metal building where Resnick, perched on the fourth floor, resides in a world of inquiry meant to lead today's kids to new, sticky learning experiences. Among other things, he and his team have developed a computer program called Scratch, which enables children to make their own video games, animation, and interactive art. "We're always about kids creating, building, designing, and inventing," Resnick said. Dating back to 1985—when Lego first struck up a partnership with MIT—the Media Lab has made the Lego brick one of its primary focuses. In fact it was Resnick and his research group who came up with the idea of the programmable brick, which contained an embedded computer capable of controlling a Lego model. They created bricks with chips. The result of their work, in turn, led to the first iteration of the Lego Mindstorms line.
	</p>

	<p>
		[...]
	</p>

	<p>
		"What I think is special about Lego is this idea of structure plus freedom."
	</p>

	<p>
		Kenney remembers a time when he was 20, when his mother was cleaning out his childhood bedroom. He took all of his Lego bricks back to college, and in his dorm room, with two other roommates, began building an elaborate city, mostly like the one across the river: New York. "They made fun of me for about two days," he said. He started giving himself all sorts of rules. A building couldn't be wider than it was tall, for instance. "Then when I'd return from class, I'd see they'd been playing too. There were alien invasions. Or I'd find the heads of all the minifigures in a pile, and just crack up."
	</p>

	<p>
		[...]
	</p>

	<p>
		So why does Lego, the name and the brick itself, lurk in the imagination, and in our lives, long after toys like the Yo-Yo Ball and Micro Machines Zbots have faded? And in an age of Xbox and PS4, in the Time of Our Digital Panoply, why are those simple bricks more popular now than ever before, racking up more than $1 billion in profits for the Lego Group in 2013?
	</p>
	<p>
		I wonder too: Does the answer partly lie in the work of a German artist named Jan Vormann, whom one can find online, roaming the world, spackling holes in crumbling city walls with rainbow Lego-brick constructions? Is that the reason that Legos resonate for us—because we need rainbow patching too? Is it that life isn't this precise Pixar rendition, but blocky and striving and shape-shifting, and in the simplicity of the Lego brick we find a certain physical, intellectual, and spiritual release?
	</p>

	<h2>
		So, where is he?
	</h2>

	<p>
		Right here, it turns out, behind the walnut door again, where he's always been. The time is right now, today, and my son just turned 15. Fifteen! He will soon have his driver's permit. He's interested in many things besides Lego. And yet here he is, making a Lego forest, enacting a chase scene. When I knock, he allows me in. He's happy to share what he's made, tolerates me fiddling with a few bricks as he adds to the forest. Besides the mechanical exercise of attaching brick to brick ("the interlocking principle," as Lego has it) and the unknowingness of what will happen (the thrill of discovery and invention), something else comes out of this exercise and these seemingly fugitive hours on a Saturday afternoon: I'm moved by memory and engagement into a timeless space, a place where thousands, nay, millions of other ghostly Lego-brick players already play, and where that sort of invisible interconnectedness lends its own meaning to the lopsided pterodactyl spaceship I make, the one that evokes laughter from my son and takes its place in the same world with his forest and Lego Mark Twain, with big Lego rubber ducky and Darth Vader.
	</p>
	<p>
		But for the moment it's pretty simple. We're just playing. And the thing is this: We have no idea what might happen next. We're building a secret that we ourselves don't know yet. There are bricks in our hands, a universe. We keep building it into being.
