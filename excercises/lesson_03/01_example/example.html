	<h1>
		This is a headline (as usual)<br>
		(This headline has a spacing to the bottom (margin)).
	</h1>

	<h2>
		This is a headline type "h2". This one I gave a specific width of 400px 
		and a height of 200px. To make it more visible I additionally gave it a 
		new background-color.
	</h2>

	<p>
		This is a simple paragraph with new styles regarding the text. <br>
		We have here a <i>sans-serif font</i>, with a <i>font-size</i> of 20px and a
		<i>color</i> in a very dark grey (#7f8c8d).
	</p>

	<p class="newText">
		This paragraph has additionally a class called "newText" with new informations 
		describing the text colour.
	</p>

	<p class="turqouise">
		This is a paragraph with the class "turqouise". This class describes a 
		white text color, a <i>background-color</i> and sets a new <i>margin</i> 
		and <i>padding</i> value additionally to the already existing CSS values
		of the general p-tags.
	</p>

	<h2 class="newText"> 
		If you have set up a class you can put it on any HTML tag you want to. E.g.
		this <i>h2</i> headline has the class "newText" too and therefore the same 
		font colour.
