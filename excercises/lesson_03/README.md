# Lesson 3: More about CSS

Download and look at the template I made in [`02_template/index.html`](02_template/index.html) in your browser. Then open the file [`03_task/index.html`](03_task/index.html) in your browser and [`03_task/style.css`](03_task/style.css) in your text editor and try rebuilding my template site. Add parameters to the CSS properties and add tags that might be missing. 

Also add classes to the HTML tags where you think some would be needed. Do not forget to declare the class in your `.css` file too!

Here are some hints:

```css
/* Fonts I used: Helvetica, Georgia;
Colors I used: #bdc3c7, #95a5a6, #7f8c8d, #f1c40f */
     
/* Some Examples of what you could need: */
p {
	margin-top: 20px; 
	padding: 10px; 
	padding-bottom: 30px; 
	background: #f1c40f;
}
.intro { 
	font-family: Georgia, serif;
}
```

When you are done with that, try changing the CSS values or think of even more classes that could be added. Play with the overwriting facts of classes and the usual HTML tags.

If you did not download [Sublime text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or another text editor yet, I would recommend to do so, it makes working with code a lot easier.

If you have trouble with the commands of CSS, have a look at the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10Nsg7NXk_VHTDfgfFqLpZeT5jJy6klCNhievULFRinw/edit?usp=sharing) or have a look at the [`01_example/index.html`](01_example/index.html) and [`01_example/style.css`](01_example/style.css), there I explained everything again within the comments (open this file in your text editor too).

I hope you don't have too many problems rebuilding everything. If you have, don't hesitate to ask me!
