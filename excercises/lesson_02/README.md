# Lesson 2 Exercise: Introduction in CSS

Download and look at the template I made in [`02_template/index.html`](02_template/index.html) in your browser. Then open the file [`03_task/index.html`](03_task/index.html) in your browser and [`03_task/style.css`](03_task/style.css) in your text editor and try rebuilding my template site **only by changing the CSS code**.

If you want to, you can of course change some of the values and play a bit with the style. Use different colors for the text for example.

Here are some hints: 

```css
/* Fonts I used: Verdana, "Comic Sans MS"
	Colors I used: #e74c3c, #7f8c8d, #bdc3c7, #000000 */

/* Some Examples of what you could need: */
p {
	font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; 
	font-size: 16px;
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: normal; 
	line-height: 20px;
	color: #000000;
	text-align: left;
	text-decoration: none;
}
```

If you have trouble with the commands of CSS, have a look at the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PIoX9QT4Xqm2X-P_OVP9qtDJiIV_ts0Ioyi9ltVWteo/edit?usp=sharing) or have a look at the [`01_example/style.css`](01_example/style.css), there I explained everything again within the comments (open this file in your text editor too).

I hope you don't have too many problems rebuilding everything. If you have, don't hesitate to ask me!
