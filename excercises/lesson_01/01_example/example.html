<!-- Every html document starts with the <html> tag. -->
<html>

  <!-- The head is an area visible for the browser, 
  but not for the visitor. -->
  <head>
	<!-- Here you define the charset (the way the 
	browser has to view at your letters). For western
	languages it is usually UTF-8.
  !! This is important to show letters like ä, ö 
  or å correctly!! -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" ></meta>

    <!-- Here you define the tilte of your website. -->
    <title> Hello world! </title>
  </head>

  <!-- The body is the "real" / visible website -->
  <body>

  	<!-- That's just some text. -->
    Hello world!

    <!-- Here you have a paragraph. -->
    <p>I am a paragraph</p>

    <!-- That is a headline, the biggest one. -->
    <h1>This is a test site.</h1>

    <!-- That is a headline 2, a bit smaller than
    the first one. -->
    <h2>Learn more about HTML:</h2>

    <!-- This text will be bold. -->
    <b>Hi, I am bold text.</b>
    
    <!-- Here you have a line break. -->
    <br>

    <!-- The thematic break is a bit strickter than 
    the normal line break. -->
    <hr>

    <!-- This text is written italic / cursive. -->
    <i>cursive</i> text.

    <!-- Without having a <br> tag, the browser does not
    see a new line, even if you have one in the actual 
    code! Some tags, like paragraph, do one automatically. -->
    That should be in a new line, shouldn't it?
    <p>But the new paragraph does it finally!</p>

    <!-- A link needs a target to know where to go to. 
    You define it in the href attribute. -->
    <a href="http://google.com" > Link to Google </a>
    <br>
    
	<!-- A image always needs its source un the src attribute. -->
    <img src="../04_template/jd.jpg" />

    <!-- To define a list, you need to open one (ol – ordered/numbers,
    or ul -  unordered/dots) and then fill in the elements using the
    li tag. -->
    <ul>
      <li>first element</li>
      <!-- You can always use some tags inside of other tags: -->
      <li><b>second</b> element</li>
      <li>third element
      	<!-- Even lists within lists! -->
        <ul>List within a list
		  <li>sub element</li>
		</ul>
      
      </li>
      <li>fourth element</li>
    </ul>

 
  <!-- In the end you have to close all tags again. -->
