	<p>
		J.D. is in his mid 30s and is married to long-time love interest <a href="elliot.html">Elliot Reid</a>.
		He previously lived with best friend <b>Christopher Turk</b> during college, med school, and for the first
		four years at Sacred Heart, and Elliot during the fifth and part of the sixth year at the hospital. <br>
		He has lived in four apartments and on a half-acre over his eight years at Sacred Heart. For a while
		he was in a relationship with <i>Kim Briggs</i>, who gave birth to his son, <i>Sam Perry Gilligan Dorian</i>.
		After Kim moved away with Sammy, J.D. started to realize how much he loved his son. One weekend at Kim's apartment,
		J.D. decided to move so he would be closer to Sammy. While visiting Kim at her job to drop off Sam, he
		was offered Residency Director for St. Vincent's Hospital, which he took. Although his friends were
		upset by this decision, he felt fulfilling his role of father was the most important thing in his life.
