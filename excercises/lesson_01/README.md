# Lesson 1 Exercise: Introduction in HTML

Look at the template I made in [`02_template/jd.html`](02_template/jd.html) in your browser. Download the folder [`03_task`](https://github.com/olivierbrcknr/html-css_tutorial/archive/main.zip) Then open the file [`05_task/task-work_here.html`](05_task/task-work_here.html) in your text editor and try to rebuild the template website.

If you have trouble with the HTML commands look at the [website](https://olivierbrcknr.github.io/html-css_tutorial/#lesson-01) or have a look at the [`02_template/jd.html`](02_template/jd.html) file, there I explained everything again within the comments (open it in you text editor too).

I hope you don't have too much problems rebuilding everything. If you have, don't hesitate to ask me!
